The method begins with performing data importing, data exploration, data cleaning and data pre-processing, followed by investigation and visualisation into a visual graph using R Studio.

I have investigated and analysed the data on the weather in the United States by employing the ggplot2 tools in order to generate a visual graph and draw a conclusion. 

The Bar charts, box plots, and scatter graphs with linear lines are representations of graphs that are used.
